# DataKitchen Data Observability Installer

This repo contains the installer and quickstart setup for the DataKitchen Data Observability product suite.
* [**DataOps TestGen**](https://docs.datakitchen.io/articles/dataops-testgen-help/dataops-testgen-help) is a data quality verification tool that does five main tasks: (1) data profiling, (2) new dataset screening and hygiene review, (3) algorithmic generation of data quality validation tests, (4) ongoing production testing of new data refreshes and (5) continuous periodic monitoring of datasets for anomalies.
* [**DataOps Observability**](https://docs.datakitchen.io/articles/dataops-observability-help/dataops-observability-help) monitors every tool used in the journey of data from data source to customer value, from any team development environment into production, across every tool, team, data set, environment, and project so that problems are detected, localized, and understood immediately.

## Prerequisites

### Install the required software

| Software                | Tested Versions               | Command to check version                |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Requirements for TestGen & Observability**
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) <br/>- Most Linux and macOS systems have Python pre-installed. <br/>- On Windows machines, you will need to download and install it.        | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12                | `python3 --version`                |

|  **Additional Requirements for Observability** |
| [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)         | 1.32.0                | `minikube version`                |

### Download the installer

On Unix-based operating systems, use the following command to download it to the current directory. We recommend creating a new, empty directory.

```shell
curl -o dk-installer.py 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataKitchen/data-observability-installer/main/dk-installer.py'
```

* Alternatively, you can manually download the [`dk-installer.py`](https://github.com/DataKitchen/data-observability-installer/blob/main/dk-installer.py) file from this repo.
* All commands listed below should be run from the folder containing this file.
* For usage help and command options, run `python3 dk-installer.py --help` or `python3 dk-installer.py <command> --help`.

### Temporary Prerequisites

Until we make the images public, Docker credentials with access to the `datakitchen` namespace have to be configured on your machine.

* Ask the development team for credentials.
* On Docker Desktop, login with the credentials.
* On the terminal, set these environment variables.
  * `export DOCKER_USERNAME=<username>`
  * `export DOCKER_PASSWORD=<password>`

## Quickstart Guide

The [Data Observability quickstart](https://docs.datakitchen.io/articles/open-source-data-observability/data-observability-overview) walks you through Dataops Observability and TestGen capabilities to demonstrate how our products cover critical use cases for data and analytic teams.

Before going through the quickstart, complete the prequisites above and then the following steps to install the two products and setup the demo data. For any of the commands, you can view additional options by appending `--help` at the end.

### Install the TestGen application

The installation downloads the latest Docker images for TestGen and deploys a new Docker Compose application. The process may take 5~10 minutes depending on your machine and network connection. 

```shell
python3 dk-installer.py tg install
```
Once it completes, verify that you can login to the UI with the URL and credentials provided in the output.

### Install the Observability application

The installation downloads the latest Helm charts and Docker images for Observability and deploys the application on a new minikube cluster. The process may take 5~30 minutes depending on your machine and network connection. 
```shell
python3 dk-installer.py obs install
```

For *Windows* and *macOS running M-series (ARM) chip* only: The Docker driver is not allowed to expose the HTTP ports to the host machine, so the following command has to be run after the install to access the application. Leave this process running, and continue the next steps on another terminal window.

```shell
python3 dk-installer.py obs expose
```
Verify that you can login to the UI with the URL and credentials provided in the output.

### Run the TestGen demo setup

The `demo-config.json` file generated by the Observability installation must be present in the folder.

```shell
python3 dk-installer.py tg run-demo --export
```
In the TestGen UI, you will see that new data profiling and test results have been generated. Additionally, in the Observavility UI, you will see that new test outcome events have been received.

### Run the Observability demo setup

The `demo-config.json` file generated by the Observability installation must be present in the folder.

```shell
python3 dk-installer.py obs run-demo
```
In the Observability UI, you will see that new journeys and events have been generated.

### Run the Agent Heartbeat demo setup

The `demo-config.json` file generated by the Observability installation must be present in the folder.

```shell
python3 dk-installer.py obs run-heartbeat-demo
```
In the Observability UI, you will see that new agents have been generated on the Integrations page.

Leave this process running, and continue with the [quickstart guide](https://docs.datakitchen.io/articles/open-source-data-observability/data-observability-overview) to tour the applications.

## Useful Commands

### DataOps TestGen

The [docker compose CLI](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) can be used to operate the installed TestGen application. All commands must be run in the same folder that contains the `docker-compose.yaml` file generated by the installation.

Access the _testgen_ CLI: `docker compose exec engine bash` (use `exit` to return to the regular terminal)

Stop the app: `docker compose down`

Restart the app: `docker compose up`

### DataOps Observability

The [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) command line tools can be used to operate the Observability application.

Inspect the pods: `kubectl get pods`

Get pod logs: `kubectl logs <POD ID>`

Stop the app: `minikube stop`

Restart the app: `minikube start`

## Remove Demo Data 

After completing the quickstart, you can remove the demo data from the applications with the following steps.

### Stop the Agent Heartbeat demo

Stop the process that is running the Agent Heartbeat demo using `Ctrl + C`.

*Note*: Currently, the agents generated by the heartbeat demo are not cleaned up.

### Remove TestGen & Observability demo data

The `demo-config.json` file generated by the Observability installation must be present in the folder.

```shell
python3 dk-installer.py tg delete-demo
python3 dk-installer.py obs delete-demo
```

## Uninstall Applications

### Uninstall TestGen
```shell
python3 dk-installer.py tg delete
```

### Uninstall Observability
```shell
python3 dk-installer.py obs delete
```
